# DM Project Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the DM Project as outlined in the *DM_project(2)(1).pdf* document. The project focuses on [assumed objective, e.g., data mining tasks such as classification, clustering, or association rule mining]. The codebase is written in Python and includes scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dm_project.git
   cd dm_project
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Prepare data**:
   Place your dataset(s) in the `data/` folder as specified in the PDF.
4. **Run the scripts**:
   Execute the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python src/analysis.py
   ```

## Dependencies
See `docs/requirements.txt` for a list of required Python packages (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

## Usage
- Run `preprocess.py` to clean and prepare the data.
- Run `analysis.py` to perform the main data mining tasks.
- Use `visualize.py` to generate plots and visualizations.
- Explore `notebooks/exploration.ipynb` for interactive analysis.

## Notes
- The `data/` folder is excluded from version control. Ensure you have the datasets referenced in the PDF.
- Update this README with specific project objectives or tasks from the *DM_project(2)(1).pdf* file.
